# MSBVH: An Efficient Acceleration Data Structure for Ray Traced Motion Blur

with M. Stich, S. Nawaz, and A. Keller.

In Proceedings of the Conference on High Performance Graphics (HPG '11).

*Abstract:* When a bounding volume hierarchy is used for accelerating the intersection
*of
rays and scene geometry, one common way to incorporate motion blur is to interpolate
node bounding volumes according to the time of the ray. However, such hierarchies
typically exhibit large overlap between bounding volumes, which results in an
inefficient traversal. This work builds upon the concept of spatially partitioning nodes
during tree construction in order to reduce overlap in the presence of moving objects.
The resulting hierarchies are often significantly cheaper to traverse than those
generated by classic approaches.
